### IOT Garbage Monitoring System 
This project IOT Garbage Monitoring system is a very innovative system which will help to keep the cities clean. This system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins via a web page or mobile APP. For this the system uses ultrasonic sensors placed over the bins to detect the garbage level and compare it with the garbage bins depth.

### Project's warehouse includes:
1. Execution 10% 
2. Report 40% 
3. Video demonstration/presentation 30% 
4. Individual interview 20%

### Statement

Hello, Junior of MIEC. If you find the program folder, prove your retrieval ability is very outstanding, and I hope that the second-year project's warehouse can give you some reference.

**It is important to note that if you get the same/or similar topic, please don't directly handle (copy) of our project. Finally, I wish you all the best in MIEC.**

MIEC的学弟学妹你们好，欢迎访问我们的IoT项目仓库。我希望这个二年级课设项目的仓库可以给你们提供一些参考——需要注意的是，如果你们拿到了一样/或相似的课题，请不要直接搬运（甚至抄袭）我们的项目。

**最后，祝你们在MIEC的旅途一切顺利。**
