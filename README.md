### IOT Garbage Monitoring System 
This project IOT Garbage Monitoring system is a very innovative system which will help to keep the cities clean. This system monitors the garbage bins and informs about the level of garbage collected in the garbage bins via a web page or mobile APP. For this the system uses ultrasonic sensors placed over the bins to detect the garbage level and compare it with the garbage bins depth.
