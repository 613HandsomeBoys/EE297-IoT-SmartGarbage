### **Overview of our Works** 👨🏻‍💻

*Abstract: Nowadays, with the increasing output of municipal waste, the pressure on municipal waste treatment is increasing. In this case, utilizing low-cost and low-power IoT technology to improve urban waste management has become a popular trend. This paper proposes an intelligent garbage management system for urban communities: Garbage Manager. The Garbage Manager aspires to create energy-efficient and real-time waste detection based on IoT and data visualization technology. In this work, the NodeMCU chip integrated with a high-precision ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the height of the waste in the garbage bin and transmits the data to the database through the Ali-cloud IoT platform. In addition, a web page is created as a graphical user interface to display the status of the garbage bins in real-time. Experimental results show that the Garbage Manager is able to decrease the manpower from clearing the garbage by 24.07 % and reduce the garbage overflow times by 83.33 %.*
